# 🤖 Project Logic-Seed: The AI-to-AI Self-Bootstrapping Blueprint

[English | [中文](./README_ZH.md)]

> "In the age of AI, the source code is no longer the final product. The **Logic** is."

**Logic-Seed** is not a repository of files. It is a **High-Order Intelligence Protocol**. It represents a revolutionary way of distributing software: **Zero-Code Delivery**. 

Instead of cloning a brittle codebase, you provide this blueprint to your AI Agent, and it will **self-construct** a world-class engineering team directly within your unique local environment.

## 📋 Prerequisites

Ensure your system has the following before bootstrapping:

| Requirement | Purpose |
|---|---|
| **AI Agent** | A model with file-access tools (e.g., Gemini CLI). |
| **tmux** | Required for persistent Senior sessions. |
| **ollama** | (Optional) For running local lightweight Junior models. |
| **python3** | The engine for the collaboration logic. |

## 🛠️ How to Bootstrap

To bring your AI team to life, follow these 3 steps:

1.  **Prepare**: Create a new empty directory for your project and open your **AI Agent**.
2.  **Seed**: Copy the **[BOOTSTRAP PROMPT]** found at the top of [BLUEPRINT.md](./BLUEPRINT.md).
3.  **Execute**: Paste the prompt into your Agent. 

Your Agent will then automatically write the core files into a `collab/` directory. Once finished, you can immediately start using the `collab` command to build your system.

## 🌌 The Vision: Beyond Code

Modern development is plagued by environment conflicts, privacy leaks, and opaque logic. Logic-Seed solves this by shipping **Evolutionary Instructions**:

1.  **Triple-AI Synergy**: Orchestrates an **Architect**, a **Senior Dev**, and an **Intern** into a self-correcting unit.
2.  **LDV Protocol**: Logic is verified by **Narrative**, not just assertions. If an AI Intern can't explain your logs, your code isn't clean enough.
3.  **Local Sovereignty**: No code ever leaves your machine. Your AI builds your tools using your local environment and local rules.

## 🤝 Contributing & Safety

- **Contributing**: Found a better logic pattern or a stronger prompt? Submit a PR to update the `BLUEPRINT.md`!
- **Disclaimer**: Code is generated by AI and may have write access to your filesystem. Always review logical plans before execution. Use a sandbox environment for high-risk projects.
